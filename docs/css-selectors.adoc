= CSS Selector Transforms

Lift's templating strategy is much simpler than most systems, and is aimed at
cleanly and completely separating business logic from markup. Many a framework
has made this claim, but Lift is one of the few to have achieved this break
completely, using only HTML annotations with `data-` attributes.

//You can find an overview of the full Lift CSS templating strategy in
//the link:templating-guide[Lift templating guide].

This document is a reference on the underpinnings of Lift templating, the CSS
Selector Transforms. These are used in Lift code to transform a block of HTML
by enriching it with data from the system and filtering it based on business
rules.

== Selectors and Replacement Rules

CSS Selector Transforms generate a function that takes in a `NodeSeq` and
transforms it according to a set of rules, producing a final `NodeSeq` with all
of the transformations applied. This means a CSS Selector Transform is
ultimately simply a function with signature `(NodeSeq)=>NodeSeq`. CSS Selector
Transforms consist of three main components:

 - The selector
 - The subnode modification rule
 - The transformation function

The details of each are provided below, but first let's look at some simple
examples of transforms that you can write with links. For all of these examples,
we'll be using this sample data:

```scala
case class User(name: String)

val user = User("Benedict Cumberbatch")
```

These examples show a few options:

 - You can select by element name or by class name. More available selectors are
   in the section below on <<available-selectors>>.
 - You can set the body of an element, an attribute of an element, or even
   replace the element altogether. More subnode modification rules are in the
   section below on <<available-modification-rules>>.
 - You can combine multiple CSS selector transforms using the `&` operator. This
   is subject to some limitations detailed in the section below on <<combining-selectors-and-transforms>>.

== Available Selectors

NOTE: You cannot chain these in the standard CSS way (e.g., `input.class-name` is not
valid). Instead, you must always put spaces between the selectors. More on this
in the section below on <<combining-selectors-and-transforms>>.

Class selector: `.class-name`::
  The class selector matches any element that has `class-name` as one of its
  classes. For example, you can use `.item` to match an element `<li
  class="item selected">...</li>`.

Id selector: `#element-id`::
  The id selector matches any element that has `element-id` as the value of its
  `id` attribute. For example, you can use `#page-header` to match an element
  `<header id="page-header">...</header>`.

Name selector: `@field-name`::
  The name selector matches any element that has `field-name` as the value of
  its `name` attribute. For example, you can use `@username` to match an element
  `<input name="username">`.

Element selector: `element-name`::
  The element selector matches any element with node name `element-name`. For
  example, you can use `input` to match an element `<input type="text">`.

Attribute selector: `an-attribute=a-value`::
  The attribute selector matches any element whose attribute named
  `an-attribute` has the value `a-value`. For example, you can use
  `ng-model=user` to match an element `<ul ng-model="user">...</ul>`.

Universal selector: `*`::
  The universal selector matches any element.

Root selector: `^`::
  The root selector matches elements at the root level of the `NodeSeq` being
  transformed. For example, you can use `^` to match both the `header`
  and `ul` elements in the HTML `<header id="page-header">...</header><ul
  ng-model="user">...</ul>`.

=== Shortened Attribute Selectors

In addition to the above base selectors, a few selectors are provided that are
useful shortcuts for special attributes:

Data name attribute selector: `;custom-name`::
  The data name attribute selector matches any element that has `custom-name` as
  the value of its `data-name` attribute. For example, you can use `;user-info`
  to match an element `<ul data-name="user-info">...</ul>`.

Field type selectors: `:button`, `:checkbox`, `:file`, `:password`, `:radio`, `:reset`, `:submit`, `:text`::
  The field type selectors match elements whose `type` attribute is set to a
  particular type. For example, `:button` will match an element `<input
  type="button">`. `:checkbox` will match an element `<input
  type="checkbox">`. Note that this is _not_ generalized. So, for example,
  `:custom-field` will _not_ match `<input type="custom-field">`. Only the above
  values are supported.

== Available Modification Rules

Subnode modification rules indicate what the result of the transformation
function will do to the element matched by the selector.

Set children rule: `*`::
  The transformation result will set the children of the matched element(s). For
  example, `^ *` will set the children of all root elements to the results of
  the transformation.

Append to children rule: `\*<` or `*+`::
  The transformation result will be appended to the children of the matched
  element(s). For example, `^ *+` will append the results of the transformation
  to the end of the content of all root elements.

Prepend to children rule: `>*` or `-*`::
  The transformation result will be prepended to the children of the matched
  element(s). For example, `^ -*` will prepend the results of the transformation
  to the beginning of the content of all root elements.

Surround children rule: `<*>`::
  The transformation result will produce a single element, whose children will
  be set to the children of the matched element(s). For example, `^ <*>` will
  take the element produced by the transformation function and copy it once for
  every root element, wrapping the new element around the children of the root
  elements.

Set attribute rule: `[attribute-name]`::
  The attribute with name `attribute-name` on the matched element will have its
  value set to the transformation result. For example, `^ [data-user-id]` will
  set the `data-user-id` attribute of all root elements to the transformation
  result.

Append to attribute rule: `[attribute-name+]`::
  The transformation result will be appended to the end of the value of the
  attribute with name `attribute-name` on the matched element with a prepended
  space. For example, `^ [class+]` will append a space and then the
  transformation result to the `class` attribute of all root elements.

Remove from attribute rule: `[attribute-name!]`::
  The transformation result will be filtered from the value of the attribute
  with name `attribute-name` on the matched element, provided it can be found on
  its own separated by a space. For example, `^ [class!]` will remove the
  class named by the transformation result from all root elements.

Don't merge attributes rule: `!!`::
  By default, if the transformation yields a single element and the element
  matched by the selector is being replaced by that result, the attributes from
  the matched element are merged into the attributes of the transformation's
  element. This modifier prevents that from happening. For example, by default
  doing `"input" #> <div />` and applying it to `<input type="text">` would
  yield `<div type="text" />`. Doing `"input !!" #> <div />` would instead yield
  `<div />`.

Lift node rule: `^^`::
  This rule will lift the first selected element all the way to the root of the
  `NodeSeq` it's being applied to. Note that the transformation result is
  irrelevant in this case. Additionally, note that this only applies to the
  _first_ element that matches the selector, and that it lifts it all the way to
  the root of the `NodeSeq` being transformed. For example,
  `".admin-user ^^" #> "ignored"`, when applied to the
  markup `<div><form><fieldset class="admin-user">...</fieldset>
  <fieldset class="power-user">...</fieldset></form></div>`, will
  produce `<fieldset class="admin-user">...</fieldset>`. This is useful for
  selecting among a set of template elements based on some external condition
  (e.g., one template for one type of user, another template for another type of
  user, etc).

Lift node's children rule: `^*`::
  This rule will lift the _children_ of the first selected element all the way
  to the root of the `NodeSeq` it's being applied to. As above, the
  transformation result is irrelevant, only the _first_ matched element's
  children are lifted, and the children are lifted all the way to the root of
  the `NodeSeq` being transformed. For example, `"#power-user ^*" #> "ignored"`,
  when applied to the markup
  `<section id="admin-user"><h3>Admin</h3></section>
  <section id="power-user"><h3>Power User</h3></section>`,
  will produce `<h3>Power User</h3>`.

== Transformation Functions

Transformation functions specify the contents used by the modification rules to
update the `NodeSeq` that is being transformed. Note that these are always
lazily computed, so if a selector doesn't match, then its transformation
function will not be run. Strictly speaking, a transformation function need
not be a _function_---sometimes it will just be a static value. More details
below.

NOTE: Two of the modification rules, `^^` and `^*`, ignore the result of the
transformation function; usually `"ignored"` is passed as the transformation
function in these cases.

The transformation function can be any type `T` that has an implicit
`CanBind[T]` available. `CanBind` requires a single `apply` method with two
parameter lists, one for the `T` value and one that is the `NodeSeq` that was
matched by the selector. For example, if you invoke `"input" #> "Hello"` with
the HTML `<div class="inputs"><input type="text"><input type="date"></div>`,
an instance of `CanBind[String]` is used, and is called twice; first as
`stringBind("Hello")(<input type="text" />)` and then as
`stringBind("Hello")(<input type="date" />)`. Note that a `CanBind[String]` is
already provided by default.

Here are a few of the more interesting `CanBind` s that are supported out of the
box by Lift:

`CanBind[Bindable]`::
  This allows you to directly use a `Mapper` or `Record` instance on the right
  hand side of the transform to put its HTML representation somewhere (as
  returned by `asHtml`).

`CanBind[StringPromotable]`::
  Lift has a `StringPromotable` trait that can be used to mark objects that can
  be straightforwardly promoted to a `String`. Amongst other things, by default
  this includes `JsCmd` s. This allows those types of objects to be put on the
  right hand side of a transform.

`CanBind[Box[T]]` and `CanBind[Option[T]]`::
  Defined for a few types, the most important characteristic of these is that
  they will return a `NodeSeq.Empty` if the `Option` or `Box` is `Empty`/`None`
  or `Failure`.

`CanBind[NodeSeq=>NodeSeq]`::
  This lets you use a full-blown transformation function. This function will
  take in the element that matched the selector and provide the modification
  rule with the results of the function. For example, you could clear an
  element by saying `".user" #> { ns: NodeSeq => NodeSeq.Empty }` footnote:[In
  fact, there is a `ClearNodes` function defined in `net.liftweb.util` that does
  exactly this.]. Because CSS Selector Transforms are themselves
  `NodeSeq=>NodeSeq` functions, you can nest them this way. For example, you
  can say `".user" #> { ".name *" #> user.name }`. Given the markup `<li
  class="user"><p class="name">Person</p></li>`, this will first select the
  `li`, then pass it to the second transform which will select the `p` and set
  its value to the user's name. Then the second transform will return the `li`
  with the user's name set up, and the top-level transform will replace the
  original, unbound `li` with the new one.

`CanBind[Iterable[T]]`::
  This is defined for most `T` values that `CanBind` is also defined for, and
  in fact it's recommended that if you provide a `CanBind` for a type `T`, you
  also provide it for `Iterable[T]`. This will repeatedly run the transform
  function that you specify for each `T` in the `Iterable`, concatenate the
  resulting `NodeSeq` s, and return that. This makes it trivial to deal with
  lists, so you can simply do something like
  `".user" #> users.map { user => ".name" #> user.name }`
  to map the names for all users. This will create a copy of the `.user` element
  for each user, and bind their name correctly. It will also ensure that if
  the matched `.user` instance has an id, only the first copy of the elements
  will have that id after the transform is finished.

There are a lot more `CanBind` s, and you can find them at the
link:docs/for/net.liftweb.util.CanBind[docs for `CanBind`].

== Combining Selectors and Transforms

Lift's selectors are not identical to CSS selectors. They're designed for speed
rather than for being featureful, and designed in the context of a full-featured
language rather than a limited language like CSS. One key difference is in how
you combine them. In CSS, you can use `>` to select direct children, `+` for
direct siblings, etc. Lift only provides one combinator, the space. It works
just like in CSS, checking all descendants of the elements matched by the
select to the left against the selector on the right. So you can set up a
selector `.user-form input [value]` and it will set the `href` attribute of all
`input` elements that have some ancestor with class `user-form`.

Notably, you cannot select `form.user input [href]`, because you cannot check
multiple selectors on a single element. In practice, this is rarely needed for
snippets because the snippet itself will typically be attached to the element
that you would usually use a more complex selector to identify.

=== Combining Transforms

You may want to apply more than one transform to a single `NodeSeq`. Indeed,
this is a fairly common thing to do in snippets. The simplest way of doing this
is to pass the result of each transformation in turn through the next
transform. For example, if you wanted to do both `"a *" #> "Mozilla"` and
`"a [href]" #> "https://mozilla.org"`, you could do:

```scala
val textReplaced = ("a *" #> "Mozilla") apply nodes
val final result = ("a [href]" #> "https://mozilla.org") apply textReplaced
```

Scala itself provides a function composition helper that lets us chain a set
of functions into a single function that runs through all of them: `andThen`.
With this, we can do:

```scala
("a *" #> "Mozilla" andThen
 "a [href]" #> "https://mozilla.org") apply nodes
```

And get the same result.

However, Lift provides one more little trick, the `&` operator. When CSS
Selector Transforms are combined via `andThen`, each transform that runs
potentially has to go through the entire set of input nodes to see where its
transformations should apply. `&` does something a little different: instead of
chaining the functions, it creates one big function that goes through the input
nodes a single time, checking at each point which of the combined transforms
should be applied and then applying them. So, you can do:

```scala
("a *" #> "Mozilla" &
 "a [href]" #> "https://mozilla.org") apply nodes
```

Beware, however, as `&` is not the same as `andThen`. To do this trickery, Lift
will only transform a part of a node once, and it won't revisit it. Specifically,
two transformations that apply directly to the same element (not its descendants
or attributes). Additionally, if your transformation applies to the body of an
element, like `a *`, the new children of the element will _not_ be transformed.
Additionally, if you replace the element itself, e.g.  with the selector `a`,
none of the other transforms for that element will run.

Thus, you will occasionally find yourself using `&` together with `andThen`; in
general you should default to `&` and switch to `andThen` when you need to in
order to apply a transform to the results of the previous one.

//== Macros and Strings
//
//Lift's CSS Selector Transforms can be used in two modes. Most basically, you
//can create a `String` with the appropriate selector and then specify the
//transformation you want to apply to matching blocks
